                    You are a <span class="font-bold">key actor</span> in your club and your community. Parents rely on you and see you as the
                    essential link between them and their children. The <span class="font-bold">feedback</span> you provide is invaluable, and your
                    work is appreciated and valued.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, you have the opportunity to share and transmit your passion for football. This passion inspires not only your
                    players, but also the parents, which can strengthen commitment within the club.
